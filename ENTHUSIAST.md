# 🔥 Join the Vanguard: The OpenRGD Enthusiast Guide

So, you've seen the vision. You understand that robots need a soul, not just code. You want to help build the "Cognitive BIOS" for the next century.

**Welcome home.**

We are not just building a file format; we are building a civilization-scale infrastructure. We need more than just Python coders. We need philosophers, engineers, writers, and connectors.

Here is how you can make an immediate, high-impact contribution today.

## 🚀 Level 1: The Evangelist (Spread the Standard)
*Time required: 5 minutes*

Open standards live or die by adoption. Help us reach critical mass.

* **Star the Repo:** It sounds trivial, but it's the #1 metric for visibility. [Click the Star](https://github.com/OpenRGD/openrgd).
* **The "Did You Know?" Drop:** When you see someone struggling with URDF or LLM hallucination on Reddit/Twitter/Discord, drop a link:
    > *"Have you checked OpenRGD? It solves the grounding problem by giving the AI a standardized self-model. https://openrgd.org"*
* **Tag Us:** Use `#OpenRGD` and `#CognitiveRobotics`. We amplify every voice.

## 🛠️ Level 2: The Builder (Create & Break)
*Time required: 1 hour*

Prove that it works. Or prove that it breaks. Both are valuable.

* **Run the "Golden Loop":** Follow the `GUIDE_IMPORT.md`. Take a random URDF from the internet, import it into OpenRGD, compile it, and export it to Isaac Lab.
* **Show Off:** Did it work? Post a screenshot of your terminal or the generated prompt on X/LinkedIn. "Just turned a dead URDF into a cognitive agent in 30 seconds."
* **Report Friction:** If something felt clunky, tell us. The "new user experience" must be flawless.

## 🏛️ Level 3: The Architect (Own a Domain)
*Time required: Recurring*

We are looking for **Domain Maintainers**. We want to assign ownership of specific JSONC files to experts.

* **Are you a Motor Expert?** Take ownership of `01_foundation/actuation_dynamics.jsonc`. Make it the best motor description format in the world.
* **Are you a Psychologist/Writer?** Own `03_agency/empathy_model.jsonc`. Define how robots should feel.
* **Are you a Lawyer?** Own `02_operation/compliance.jsonc`. Align it with the EU AI Act.

**How to apply:**
Open an Issue titled: `[RFC] Application for Domain Stewardship: <Domain_Name>`. Tell us why you are the right person to guard that file.

## 🔮 Level 4: The Visionary (Draft the Future)

Do you have a crazy idea for `06_ether`? Do you want to define how robots dream (`oneiric_state`)?

* **Don't ask for permission.** Fork the repo.
* Create a new file in `spec/experimental/`.
* Write your dream schema.
* Submit a Pull Request with the tag `[PROPOSAL]`.
